# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

During my internship at United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze company financials. I cleaned and prepared the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, correcting data types, and establishing key financial relationships. The dashboard tracks essential KPIs, including Total COGS, Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Discount, and Total Units Sold, providing insights into sales performance, discount impact, and profitability trends. This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, financial analysis, and Power BI visualization. The project files are available on GitHub for reference and further development.
